"""F04: the four delivery checks, run together and reported without rounding up.

The work package asks for four things: every result regenerable, the source text
audited against the work packages, the outline and the rendered book in step,
and a reader entry that actually works. Each is checked here on its own and
reported on its own. A pass in three of them is not a pass.

Nothing in this module regenerates anything. It reads what is on disk and says
whether it holds together, so that a green result means the checked-in state is
consistent rather than that a rebuild would fix it.
